\section{Results}
    \subsection{Summary}
        We have found a total of \todo publications describing the development or adaption of GAN algorithms for OHD, presented in Table \ref{tab:citeinc}. The type of data addressed in each of these publications can be generalized into one of two categories: time-dependent observations, such as time-series, or static representation in the form of feature tables. Publications considering privacy either perform privacy evaluations of their algorithms and synthetic data, or exclusively concentrate on comparing methods about privacy.

        The most efforts are focused on adapting the current methods to the characteristics and complexities of OHD, of which multi-modality or non-Gaussian continuous features, heterogeneity, a combination of discrete and continuous features, longitudinal irregularity, correlation complexity, missingness or sparsity, class imbalance and noise are often cited. While these properties may pose a challenge for the development of useful algorithms, others aspects make the prospect of success highly valuable. In fact, the most cited motive to develop OHD-GAN is to cope with the often limited number of samples in medical datasets and to overcome the highly restricted access to OHD.\par
