        Dimension-wise prediction (DWP) & Each variable is in turn chosen as the prediction target label and the remaining as features. Two predictors are trained to predict the label, one from the synthetic data and another from a portion of the real data. Their performance is compared on the left out real data.  & \cite{choi2017generating,Camino2018-re,Goncalves2020,yan2020generating}\\[20pt]

        Train on synthetic, test on real (TRTS) & Accuracy on real data of some form of predictor trained on synthetic data \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct}. Correlation between important features (RF) and model coefficients (LR and SVM) \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct}. & \cite{esteban2017real,Xu2019-ay,Yoon2018-dm,chin2019generation}\\

        Forward prediction accuracy of conditional generative model &
        Models trained to make forward predictions from past observations or from real data transformed with a known function can simply be evaluated for accuracy. & \cite{Xiao2018-aj,mcdermott2018semi,yoon2018gain,Yang_2019b}\\

        Data augmentation & A predictor is trained on a combination dataset of real and synthetic data and performance is compared with the same predictor trained on real data alone. & \cite{Yoon2018-mo}\\
        
        Predictor augmentation & The trained generative model is incorporated into a predictor's activation function by generating an ensemble of proximate data points for each instance, thereby improving generalization. & \cite{Che_2017}\\
