        Dimensions-wise distribution (DWD) & A generative model is trained on the real data to generate a dataset of the same size. The Bernoillli success probability is compared between both datasets for each feature. & \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct,choi2017generating,chin2019generation,yan2020generating,Baowaly2019,Baowaly_2019,ozyigit2020generation}\\
        Interdimensional correlation & Dimenion-wise Pearson coefficient correlation matrices for both real and synthetic data are compared. & \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct, Goncalves2020}\cite{torfi2019generating,Frid_Adar_2018,Yang_2019,ozyigit2020generation}\\
        First-order proximity metric & Widely adopted measure the similarity of graphs. In this case undirected weighted graphs are built from the co-occurrence of medical codes & \cite{Zhang2020-wp}\\
