\section{Source-code and datasets}
The algorithms presented in this review can undoubtedly find usefulness for other health data or similar problems. Most importantly they can be reevaluated on other datasets or improved by adapting them with latest ML techniques. We present in Table \ref{tab:5:sourcecode} a list of links to the source code published by the authors. In addition, we present in Table \ref{tab:5:datasets} the datasets which were employed by the authors in their experiments, for those who were referenced and available. A broad variety of articles about generative and predictive algorithms published along with the source-code can be on \href{https://paperswithcode.com}{Papers With Code} in the \href{https://paperswithcode.com/area/medical}{medical section}. Notably, they host a yearly ML Reproducibility Challenge to "[...] encourage the publishing and sharing of scientific results that are reliable and reproducible." in which papers accepted for publication in top conferences are evaluated by members of the community reproducing their experiments \cite{Sinha}. Benchmarks are also presented on the website, but unfortunately \gls{corgan} is the only entry in the medical section.
