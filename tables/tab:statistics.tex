            Dimensions-wise distribution (DWD) & The real and synthetic data are compared feature-wise according to a variety of methods For example, the Bernoillli success probability for binary features, or the Student T-test for continuous variables, and Pearson Chi-square test for binary variables is used to determine statistical significance.& \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct,choi2017generating,chin2019generation,yan2020generating,Baowaly2019,Baowaly_2019,ozyigit2020generation,tanti2019, Yoon2020-anon, tanti2019}\\

            Cross-type Conditional Distribution (CCD) & Correlations between categorical and continuous features, comparing the mean and standard deviation of each conditional distribution. & \cite{yan2020generating}\\
            
            pairwise mutual information scores & Checks for the presence multivariate relashionships pair-wise for each feature in every datasets. & \cite{Rankin2020}

            Log-cluster metric & The real and synthetic data are combined and a clustering anaylis is applied to the merged data. The metric is calculated from the number of real and synthetic samples that fall in the same clusters.  & \cite{Goncalves2020}\\
            
            Support coverage metric & Measures how much of the variables support in the real data is covered in the synthetic data. Penalizes less frequent categories that are underrepresented. & \cite{Goncalves2020}\\
            
            Time-lagged correlations and covariates & {} & \cite{Fisher2019,walsh2020generating}\\
            
            Latent Space Representation (LSR) & A $\beta$-Variational \gls{ae} is used to project the real and synthetic data to their latent representation to compare the dimensional variances. & \cite{yan2020generating}\\
            
            Distribution of Jaccard similarity & {} & \cite{ozyigit2020generation}\\
