        \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Data utility metrics}}\\ \midrule
        
        Dimension-wise prediction (DWP) & Each variable is in turn chosen as the prediction target label and the remaining as features. Two predictors are trained to predict the label, one from the synthetic data and another from a portion of the real data. Their performance is compared on the left out real data.  & \cite{Choi2017-nt,Camino2018-re,Goncalves2020,yan2020generating, tanti2019}\\[30pt]
        
        Association Rule Mining (ARM) & ARM aims to the discovery of relationships among a large set of variables, commonly occurring variable-value pairs \cite{Agrawal1993}. The rules obtained from the real and synthetic data are compared.  & \cite{baowaly_2019_IEEE,baowaly_2019_jamia,BaeAnomiGAN2020,yan2020generating}\\[30pt]
        
        Discriminating Siamese architecture & A pair of identical \gls{ffn} each receive either a real sample or a synthetic sample. Their output is passed to a third network which outputs a measure of similarity. & \cite{torfi2019generating}\\[30pt]
        
        Predictor performance & Performance of predictors trained on the synthetic data, often in comparison with the real data or data generated with \gls{dp}. & \cite{BaeAnomiGAN2020}
        
        Train on synthetic, test on real (TRTS) & Accuracy on real data of some form of predictor trained on synthetic data & \cite{Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct, Rankin2020} \\ [30pt]
        
        Train on real, test on synthetic (TSTR) & Accuracy on synthetic data of some form of predictor trained on real data &  \cite{BaeAnomiGAN2020, Yoon2020-anon}\\[30pt]
        
        Model analysis & Correlation between important features (RF) and model coefficients (LR and SVM) & \cite{esteban2017real,Xu2019-ay,Yoon2020-anon,chin2019generation, Beaulieu-Jones2019-ct}\\[30pt]
        
        Forward prediction & Models trained to make forward predictions from past observations or from real data transformed with a known function can simply be evaluated for accuracy. For example, the RMSE on time-series. & \cite{Xiao2018-aj,mcdermott2018semi,yoon2018imputation,Yang_2019_cdss, zhu_2020}\\ \midrule

        \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Applied utility metrics}}\\ \midrule
        
        Data augmentation & A predictor is trained on a combination dataset of real and synthetic data or real data with missing values imputed and performance is compared with the same predictor trained on real data alone. & \cite{Yoon2020-anon, Yang_2019_cdss, Yang_2019_ehr}\\
        
        Predictor augmentation & The trained generative model is incorporated into a predictor's activation function by generating an ensemble of proximate data points for each instance, thereby improving generalization. & \cite{Che_2017}\\
