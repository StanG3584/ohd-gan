\section{Algorithms and datasets}
The algorithms presented in this review can undoubtetdly find usefulness for other health data or similar problems. Most importantly they can be reevaluated on other datasets or improved by adapting them with latest ML techniques. We present in Table \ref{tab:sourcecode} a list of links to the source code published by the authors. In addition, we present in Table \ref{tab:datasets} the datasets which were employed by the authors in their experiments, for those who were referenced and available. 

\begin{table}
