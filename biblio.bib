The generated EHR data will be more realistic than those generated using the existing medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN) method.We modified medGAN to obtain two synthetic data generation modelsâ€”designated as medical Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (medWGAN) and medical boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN)â€”and compared the results obtained using the three models. We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the modelsâ€™ performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction).We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best.To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services. Moreover, they will eliminate barriers including limited access to EHR data and thus accelerate research on medical informatics.The proposed models can adequately learn the data distribution of real EHRs and efficiently generate realistic synthetic EHRs. The results show the superiority of our models over the existing model.}",

@article{Zhang2020,
abstract = {Objective: Electronic medical records (EMRs) can support medical research and discovery, but privacy risks limit the sharing of such data on a wide scale. Various approaches have been developed to mitigate risk, including record simulation via generative adversarial networks (GANs). While showing promise in certain application domains, GANs lack a principled approach for EMR data that induces subpar simulation. In this article, we improve EMR simulation through a novel pipeline that (1) enhances the learning model, (2) incorporates evaluation criteria for data utility that informs learning, and (3) refines the training process. Materials and Methods: We propose a new electronic health record generator using a GAN with a Wasserstein divergence and layer normalization techniques. We designed 2 utility measures to characterize similarity in the structural properties of real and simulated EMRs in the original and latent space, respectively. We applied a filtering strategy to enhance GAN training for low-prevalence clinical concepts. We evaluated the new and existing GANs with utility and privacy measures (membership and disclosure attacks) using billing codes from over 1 million EMRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Results: The proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches with significant improvement in retaining the nature of real records, including prediction performance and structural properties, without sacrificing privacy. Additionally, the filtering strategy achieved higher utility when the EMR training dataset was small. Conclusions: These findings illustrate that EMR simulation through GANs can be substantially improved through more appropriate training, modeling, and evaluation criteria.},

@inproceedings{Petzka2018,
abstract = {Since their invention, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a popular approach for learning to model a distribution of real (unlabeled) data. Convergence problems during training are overcome by Wasserstein GANs which minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight clipping. Augmenting the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient norm of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one, was proposed as an alternative that improves training. We present theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by experimental results on several data sets.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using pairs of deep neural networks, we generated simulated, synthetic participants that closely resemble participants of the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Trial). We showed that such paired networks can be trained with differential privacy, a formal privacy framework that limits the likelihood that queries of the synthetic participants; data could identify a real a participant in the trial. Machine learning predictors built on the synthetic population generalize to the original data set. This finding suggests that the synthetic data can be shared with others enabling them to perform hypothesis-generating analyses as though they had the original trial data. CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural networks that generate synthetic participants facilitate secondary analyses and reproducible investigation of clinical data sets by enhancing data sharing while preserving participant privacy.},

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made releasing of synthetic images a viable approach to share data without releasing the original dataset. It has been shown that such synthetic data can be used for a variety of downstream tasks such as training classifiers that would otherwise require the original dataset to be shared. However, recent work has shown that the GAN models and their synthetically generated data can be used to infer the training set membership by an adversary who has access to the entire dataset and some auxiliary information. Here we develop a new GAN architecture (privGAN) which provides protection against this mode of attack while leading to negligible loss in downstream performances. Our architecture explicitly prevents overfitting to the training set thereby providing implicit protection against white-box attacks. The main contributions of this paper are: i) we propose a novel GAN architecture that can generate synthetic data in a privacy preserving manner and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against white--box attacks on several benchmark datasets, ii) we provide a theoretical understanding of the optimal solution of the GAN loss function, iii) we demonstrate on two common benchmark datasets that synthetic images generated by privGAN lead to negligible loss in downstream performance when compared against non--private GANs. While we have focosued on benchmarking privGAN exclusively of image datasets, the architecture of privGAN is not exclusive to image datasets and can be easily extended to other types of datasets.},

A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications. Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task. While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison. As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field. In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 24 quantitative and 5 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models. I also provide a set of 7 desiderata followed by an evaluation of whether a given measure or a family of measures is compatible with them.},

abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are commonly used by the machine learning community for research on problems specifically related to health care and medicine. EHRs have the advantages that they can be easily distributed and contain many features useful for e.g. classification problems. What makes EHR data sets different from typical machine learning data sets is that they are often very sparse, due to their high dimensionality, and often contain heterogeneous data types. Furthermore, the data sets deal with sensitive information, which limits the distribution of any models learned using them, due to privacy concerns. In this work, we explore using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic, heterogeneous EHRs with the goal of using these synthetic records in place of existing data sets. We will further explore applying differential privacy (DP) preserving optimization in order to produce differentially private synthetic EHR data sets, which provide rigorous privacy guarantees, and are therefore more easily shareable. The performance of our model's synthetic, heterogeneous data is very close to the original data set (within 6.4{\%}) for the non-DP model. Although around 20{\%} worse, the DP synthetic data is still usable for machine learning tasks.},

abstract = {Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted increasing attention. However, in existing approaches, the events in EHRs are treated as separate variables which are indiscriminately entered into the model, without taking into account the meaning and grouping of them. Besides, the efficacy of treatment is often neglected. In this paper, we first embed the efficacy information into the disease diagnosis, and then propose Grouped Correlational GAN (GcGAN) to explicitly learn inherent correlations between different groups of variables. We also introduce a dense connection to strengthen the generator capacity in GcGAN. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the generated data from GcGAN are able to simulate real-world data in terms of distribution statistics. The results on multi-label treatment recommendation tasks show that GcGAN can boost the performances by augmenting the training dataset with the generated data and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It can also automatically distinguish between disease-specific drugs and adjuvant drugs, which enhances the model interpretability.},

abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, its application in the medical field becomes more and more extensive. However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based health service system, labeling a large number of medical data requires high cost and relevant domain knowledge. Therefore, how to use a small number of labeled medical data reasonably to build an efficient and high-quality clinical decision support model in the IoT-based platform has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach in association with generative adversarial networks (GANs) for supporting clinical decision making in the IoT-based health service system. In our approach, GAN is adopted to not only increase the number of labeled data but also to compensate the imbalanced labeled classes with additional artificial data in order to improve the semi-supervised learning performance. Extensive evaluations on a collection of benchmarks and real-world medical datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others and provides a potential solution for practical applications.},

@inproceedings{ranzato2007unsupervised,
abstract = {We present an unsupervised method for learning a hierarchy of sparse feature detectors that are invariant to small shifts and distortions. The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64{\%} error on MNIST, and 54{\%} average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a simple strategy to cope with missing data in sequential
      inputs, addressing the task of multilabel classification of diagnoses
      given clinical time series. Collected from the intensive care unit (ICU)
      of a major urban medical center, our data consists of multivariate time
      series of observations. The data is irregularly sampled, leading to
      missingness patterns in re-sampled sequences. In this work, we show the
      remarkable ability of RNNs to make effective use of binary indicators to
      directly model missing data, improving AUC and F1significantly. However,
      while RNNs can learn arbitrary functions of the missing data and
      observations, linear models can only learn substitution values. For linear
      models and MLPs, we show an alternative strategy to capture this signal.
      Additionally, we evaluate LSTMs, MLPs, and linear models trained on
      missingness patterns only, showing that for several diseases, what tests
      are run can be more predictive than the results themselves.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

This second step facilitates data handling for external users, by avoiding de-identification, which may require special user training, be costly, and/or cause loss of data fidelity. We benchmark our proposed GAN versus various baseline methods using a novel set of metrics. At equal levels of privacy and utility, GANs provide small footprint models, meeting the desired specifications of our application domain.

abstract = {When individual-level health data is shared in biomedical research the privacy of patients and probands must be protected. This is typically achieved with methods of data de-identification, which transform data in such a way that formal guarantees about the degree of protection from re-identification can be provided. In the process it is important to minimize loss of information to ensure that the resulting data is useful. A typical use case is the creation of predictive models for knowledge discovery and decision support, e.g. to infer diagnoses or to predict outcomes of therapies. A variety of methods have been developed which can be used to build robust statistical classifiers from de-identified data. However, they have not been tuned for practical use and they have not been implemented into mature software tools. To bridge this gap, we have extended ARX, an open source anonymization tool for health data, with several new features. We have implemented a method for optimizing the suitability of de-identified data for building statistical classifiers and a method for assessing the performance of classifiers built from de-identified data. All methods are accessible via a comprehensive graphical user interface. We have used our implementation to create logistic regression models from a patient discharge dataset for predicting the costs of hospital stays. The results show that our approach enables the creation of privacy-preserving classifiers with optimal prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.},

@article{Papernot2017,
abstract = {Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as “teachers” for a “student” model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers to a “student” model the knowledge of an ensemble of “teacher” models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers' answers. However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets. In this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers of output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For this, we introduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that are more selective and add less noise, and prove their tighter differential-privacy guarantees. Our new mechanisms build on two insights: the chance of teacher consensus is increased by using more concentrated noise and, lacking consensus, no answer need be given to a student. The consensus answers used are more likely to be correct, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur lower-differential privacy cost. Our evaluation shows our mechanisms improve on the original PATE on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy ($\epsilon$ {\textless} 1.0).},

@inproceedings{Jolicoeur-Martineau2019,
abstract = {In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator D estimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator G is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and 3) SGAN would be more similar to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs. We show that this property can be induced by using a “relativistic discriminator” which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function. Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by 400{\%}), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images (256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP and SGAN with spectral normalization.

@article{Bae2020,
abstract = {Typical personal medical data contains sensitive information about individuals. Storing or sharing the personal medical data is thus often risky. For example, a short DNA sequence can provide information that can identify not only an individual, but also his or her relatives. Nonetheless, most countries and researchers agree on the necessity of collecting personal medical data. This stems from the fact that medical data, including genomic data, are an indispensable resource for further research and development regarding disease prevention and treatment. To prevent personal medical data from being misused, techniques to reliably preserve sensitive information should be developed for real world applications. In this paper, we propose a framework called anonymized generative adversarial networks (AnomiGAN), to preserve the privacy of personal medical data, while also maintaining high prediction performance. We compared our method to state-of-The-Art techniques and observed that our method preserves the same level of privacy as differential privacy (DP) and provides better prediction results. We also observed that there is a trade-off between privacy and prediction results that depends on the degree of preservation of the original data. Here, we provide a mathematical overview of our proposed model and demonstrate its validation using UCI machine learning repository datasets in order to highlight its utility in practice.
