   abstract      = "Over the past few years, providers such as Google,
                    Microsoft, and Amazon have started to provide customers with
                    access to software interfaces allowing them to easily embed
                    machine learning tasks into their applications. Overall,
                    organizations can now use Machine Learning as a Service
                    (MLaaS) engines to outsource complex tasks, e.g., training
                    classifiers, performing predictions, clustering, etc. They
                    can also let others query models trained on their data.
                    Naturally, this approach can also be used (and is often
                    advocated) in other contexts, including government
                    collaborations, citizen science projects, and
                    business-to-business partnerships. However, if malicious
                    users were able to recover data used to train these models,
                    the resulting information leakage would create serious
                    issues. Likewise, if the inner parameters of the model are
                    considered proprietary information, then access to the model
                    should not allow an adversary to learn such parameters. In
                    this document, we set to review privacy challenges in this
                    space, providing a systematic review of the relevant
                    research literature, also exploring possible
                    countermeasures. More specifically, we provide ample
                    background information on relevant concepts around machine
                    learning and privacy. Then, we discuss possible adversarial
                    models and settings, cover a wide range of attacks that
                    relate to private and/or sensitive information leakage, and
                    review recent results attempting to defend against such
                    attacks. Finally, we conclude with a list of open problems
                    that require more work, including the need for better
                    evaluations, more targeted defenses, and the study of the
                    relation to policy and data protection efforts.",

                   facilitating multiple organizations' data collaboration
                   without revealing their private data to each other.
                   Recently, vertical FL, where the participating organizations
                   hold the same set of samples but with disjoint features and
                   only one organization owns the labels, has received
                   increased attention. This paper presents several feature
                   inference attack methods to investigate the potential
                   privacy leakages in the model prediction stage of vertical
                   FL. The attack methods consider the most stringent setting
                   that the adversary controls only the trained vertical FL
                   model and the model predictions, relying on no background
                   information. We first propose two specific attacks on the
                   logistic regression (LR) and decision tree (DT) models,
                   according to individual prediction output. We further design
                   a general attack method based on multiple prediction outputs
                   accumulated by the adversary to handle complex models, such
                   as neural networks (NN) and random forest (RF) models.
                   Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
                   the proposed attacks and highlight the need for designing
                   private mechanisms to protect the prediction outputs in
                   vertical FL.",

                   awareness, the traditional centralized approach of training
                   artificial intelligence (AI) models is facing strong
                   challenges. Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as
                   a promising solution under this new reality. Existing FL
                   protocol design has been shown to exhibit vulnerabilities
                   which can be exploited by adversaries both within and
                   without the system to compromise data privacy. It is thus of
                   paramount importance to make FL system designers to be aware
                   of the implications of future FL algorithm design on
                   privacy-preservation. Currently, there is no survey on this

                   between user-specific private information and data while
                   maintaining the useful information. Rather than learning a
                   large model to achieve privatization from end to end, we
                   introduce a decoupling of the creation of a latent
                   representation and the privatization of data that allows
                   user-specific privatization to occur in a distributed
                   setting with limited computation and minimal disturbance on
                   the utility of the data. We leverage a Variational
                   Autoencoder (VAE) to create a compact latent representation
                   of the data; however, the VAE remains fixed for all devices

                   on individual preferences regarding the private and utility
                   information. The small filter is trained by utilizing a
                   GAN-type robust optimization that can take place on a
                   distributed device. We conduct experiments on three popular

              privacy, as a promising mathematical model, has several
              attractive properties that can help solve these problems, making

              has been broadly applied in AI but to date, no study has

  author   = "Li, N and Li, T and Venkatasubramanian, S",
  abstract = "The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata
              requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that
              are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain
              ``identifying'' attributes) contains at least k records.
              Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot
              prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of ℓ-diversity has been
              proposed to address this; ℓ-diversity requires that each
              equivalence class has at least ℓ well-represented (in Section 2)
              values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper, we show that
              ℓ-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is
              neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure.
              Motivated by these limitations, we propose a new notion of
              privacy called ``closeness.'' We first present the base model
              t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive
              attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution
              of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between
              the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We
              then propose a more flexible privacy model called (n,t)-closeness
              that offers higher utility. We describe our desiderata for
              designing a distance measure between two probability
              distributions and present two distance measures. We discuss the
              rationale for using closeness as a privacy measure and illustrate
              its advantages through examples and experiments.",

   abstract      = "Local differential privacy is a widely studied restriction
                    on distributed algorithms that collect aggregates about
                    sensitive user data, and is now deployed in several large
                    systems. We initiate a systematic study of a fundamental
                    limitation of locally differentially private protocols: they
                    are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation. While any
                    algorithm can be manipulated by adversaries who lie about
                    their inputs, we show that any non-interactive locally
                    differentially private protocol can be manipulated to a much
                    greater extent. Namely, when the privacy level is high or
                    the input domain is large, an attacker who controls a small
                    fraction of the users in the protocol can completely obscure
                    the distribution of the users' inputs. We also show that
                    existing protocols differ greatly in their resistance to
                    manipulation, even when they offer the same accuracy
                    guarantee with honest execution. Our results suggest caution
                    when deploying local differential privacy and reinforce the
                    importance of efficient cryptographic techniques for
                    emulating mechanisms from central differential privacy in

We used 2 databases: MIMIC-III and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), Taiwan. First, we trained the models and generated synthetic EHRs by using these three 3 models. We then analyzed and compared the modelsâ€™ performance by using a few statistical methods (Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test, dimension-wise probability for binary data, and dimension-wise average count for count data) and 2 machine learning tasks (association rule mining and prediction).We conducted a comprehensive analysis and found our models were adequately efficient for generating synthetic EHR data. The proposed models outperformed medGAN in all cases, and among the 3 models, boundary-seeking GAN (medBGAN) performed the best.To generate realistic synthetic EHR data, the proposed models will be effective in the medical industry and related research from the viewpoint of providing better services. Moreover, they will eliminate barriers including limited access to EHR data and thus accelerate research on medical informatics.The proposed models can adequately learn the data distribution of real EHRs and efficiently generate realistic synthetic EHRs. The results show the superiority of our models over the existing model.}",

@article{Zhang2020,
abstract = {Objective: Electronic medical records (EMRs) can support medical research and discovery, but privacy risks limit the sharing of such data on a wide scale. Various approaches have been developed to mitigate risk, including record simulation via generative adversarial networks (GANs). While showing promise in certain application domains, GANs lack a principled approach for EMR data that induces subpar simulation. In this article, we improve EMR simulation through a novel pipeline that (1) enhances the learning model, (2) incorporates evaluation criteria for data utility that informs learning, and (3) refines the training process. Materials and Methods: We propose a new electronic health record generator using a GAN with a Wasserstein divergence and layer normalization techniques. We designed 2 utility measures to characterize similarity in the structural properties of real and simulated EMRs in the original and latent space, respectively. We applied a filtering strategy to enhance GAN training for low-prevalence clinical concepts. We evaluated the new and existing GANs with utility and privacy measures (membership and disclosure attacks) using billing codes from over 1 million EMRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Results: The proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches with significant improvement in retaining the nature of real records, including prediction performance and structural properties, without sacrificing privacy. Additionally, the filtering strategy achieved higher utility when the EMR training dataset was small. Conclusions: These findings illustrate that EMR simulation through GANs can be substantially improved through more appropriate training, modeling, and evaluation criteria.},

@inproceedings{Petzka2018,
abstract = {Since their invention, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a popular approach for learning to model a distribution of real (unlabeled) data. Convergence problems during training are overcome by Wasserstein GANs which minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight clipping. Augmenting the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient norm of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one, was proposed as an alternative that improves training. We present theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by experimental results on several data sets.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using pairs of deep neural networks, we generated simulated, synthetic participants that closely resemble participants of the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Trial). We showed that such paired networks can be trained with differential privacy, a formal privacy framework that limits the likelihood that queries of the synthetic participants; data could identify a real a participant in the trial. Machine learning predictors built on the synthetic population generalize to the original data set. This finding suggests that the synthetic data can be shared with others enabling them to perform hypothesis-generating analyses as though they had the original trial data. CONCLUSIONS: Deep neural networks that generate synthetic participants facilitate secondary analyses and reproducible investigation of clinical data sets by enhancing data sharing while preserving participant privacy.},

  author = {Mukherjee, Sumit and Xu, Yixi and Trivedi, Anusua and Ferres, Juan Lavista},
  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made releasing of synthetic images a viable approach to share data without releasing the original dataset. It has been shown that such synthetic data can be used for a variety of downstream tasks such as training classifiers that would otherwise require the original dataset to be shared. However, recent work has shown that the GAN models and their synthetically generated data can be used to infer the training set membership by an adversary who has access to the entire dataset and some auxiliary information. Here we develop a new GAN architecture (privGAN) which provides protection against this mode of attack while leading to negligible loss in downstream performances. Our architecture explicitly prevents overfitting to the training set thereby providing implicit protection against white-box attacks. The main contributions of this paper are: i) we propose a novel GAN architecture that can generate synthetic data in a privacy preserving manner and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against white--box attacks on several benchmark datasets, ii) we provide a theoretical understanding of the optimal solution of the GAN loss function, iii) we demonstrate on two common benchmark datasets that synthetic images generated by privGAN lead to negligible loss in downstream performance when compared against non--private GANs. While we have focosued on benchmarking privGAN exclusively of image datasets, the architecture of privGAN is not exclusive to image datasets and can be easily extended to other types of datasets.},

abstract = {Generative models, in particular generative adversarial networks (GANs), have gained significant attention in recent years. A number of GAN variants have been proposed and have been utilized in many applications. Despite large strides in terms of theoretical progress, evaluating and comparing GANs remains a daunting task. While several measures have been introduced, as of yet, there is no consensus as to which measure best captures strengths and limitations of models and should be used for fair model comparison. As in other areas of computer vision and machine learning, it is critical to settle on one or few good measures to steer the progress in this field. In this paper, I review and critically discuss more than 24 quantitative and 5 qualitative measures for evaluating generative models with a particular emphasis on GAN-derived models. I also provide a set of 7 desiderata followed by an evaluation of whether a given measure or a family of measures is compatible with them.},

abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are commonly used by the machine learning community for research on problems specifically related to health care and medicine. EHRs have the advantages that they can be easily distributed and contain many features useful for e.g. classification problems. What makes EHR data sets different from typical machine learning data sets is that they are often very sparse, due to their high dimensionality, and often contain heterogeneous data types. Furthermore, the data sets deal with sensitive information, which limits the distribution of any models learned using them, due to privacy concerns. In this work, we explore using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic, heterogeneous EHRs with the goal of using these synthetic records in place of existing data sets. We will further explore applying differential privacy (DP) preserving optimization in order to produce differentially private synthetic EHR data sets, which provide rigorous privacy guarantees, and are therefore more easily shareable. The performance of our model's synthetic, heterogeneous data is very close to the original data set (within 6.4{\%}) for the non-DP model. Although around 20{\%} worse, the DP synthetic data is still usable for machine learning tasks.},

abstract = {Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted increasing attention. However, in existing approaches, the events in EHRs are treated as separate variables which are indiscriminately entered into the model, without taking into account the meaning and grouping of them. Besides, the efficacy of treatment is often neglected. In this paper, we first embed the efficacy information into the disease diagnosis, and then propose Grouped Correlational GAN (GcGAN) to explicitly learn inherent correlations between different groups of variables. We also introduce a dense connection to strengthen the generator capacity in GcGAN. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the generated data from GcGAN are able to simulate real-world data in terms of distribution statistics. The results on multi-label treatment recommendation tasks show that GcGAN can boost the performances by augmenting the training dataset with the generated data and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It can also automatically distinguish between disease-specific drugs and adjuvant drugs, which enhances the model interpretability.},

abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, its application in the medical field becomes more and more extensive. However, with a dramatic increase in medical data obtained from the IoT-based health service system, labeling a large number of medical data requires high cost and relevant domain knowledge. Therefore, how to use a small number of labeled medical data reasonably to build an efficient and high-quality clinical decision support model in the IoT-based platform has been an urgent research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning approach in association with generative adversarial networks (GANs) for supporting clinical decision making in the IoT-based health service system. In our approach, GAN is adopted to not only increase the number of labeled data but also to compensate the imbalanced labeled classes with additional artificial data in order to improve the semi-supervised learning performance. Extensive evaluations on a collection of benchmarks and real-world medical datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others and provides a potential solution for practical applications.},

@inproceedings{ranzato2007unsupervised,
abstract = {We present an unsupervised method for learning a hierarchy of sparse feature detectors that are invariant to small shifts and distortions. The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64{\%} error on MNIST, and 54{\%} average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a simple strategy to cope with missing data in sequential
      inputs, addressing the task of multilabel classification of diagnoses
      given clinical time series. Collected from the intensive care unit (ICU)
      of a major urban medical center, our data consists of multivariate time
      series of observations. The data is irregularly sampled, leading to
      missingness patterns in re-sampled sequences. In this work, we show the
      remarkable ability of RNNs to make effective use of binary indicators to
      directly model missing data, improving AUC and F1significantly. However,
      while RNNs can learn arbitrary functions of the missing data and
      observations, linear models can only learn substitution values. For linear
      models and MLPs, we show an alternative strategy to capture this signal.
      Additionally, we evaluate LSTMs, MLPs, and linear models trained on
      missingness patterns only, showing that for several diseases, what tests
      are run can be more predictive than the results themselves.},

abstract = {We present a new technique called "t-SNE" that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

We present an end-to-end methodology to retain instructional utility, while preserving privacy to a level, which meets regulatory requirements: (1) a GAN is trained by a certified medical-data security-aware agent, inside a secure environment; (2) the final GAN model is used outside of the secure environment by external users (instructors or researchers) to generate synthetic data. This second step facilitates data handling for external users, by avoiding de-identification, which may require special user training, be costly, and/or cause loss of data fidelity. We benchmark our proposed GAN versus various baseline methods using a novel set of metrics. At equal levels of privacy and utility, GANs provide small footprint models, meeting the desired specifications of our application domain.

abstract = {When individual-level health data is shared in biomedical research the privacy of patients and probands must be protected. This is typically achieved with methods of data de-identification, which transform data in such a way that formal guarantees about the degree of protection from re-identification can be provided. In the process it is important to minimize loss of information to ensure that the resulting data is useful. A typical use case is the creation of predictive models for knowledge discovery and decision support, e.g. to infer diagnoses or to predict outcomes of therapies. A variety of methods have been developed which can be used to build robust statistical classifiers from de-identified data. However, they have not been tuned for practical use and they have not been implemented into mature software tools. To bridge this gap, we have extended ARX, an open source anonymization tool for health data, with several new features. We have implemented a method for optimizing the suitability of de-identified data for building statistical classifiers and a method for assessing the performance of classifiers built from de-identified data. All methods are accessible via a comprehensive graphical user interface. We have used our implementation to create logistic regression models from a patient discharge dataset for predicting the costs of hospital stays. The results show that our approach enables the creation of privacy-preserving classifiers with optimal prediction accuracy.},

The key privacy guarantee that has emerged is differential privacy. Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database. In this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it. We then show some interesting applications of these techniques, presenting algorithms for three specific tasks and three general results on differentially private learning.},

abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.},

abstract = {Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as “teachers” for a “student” model. The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy. These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings. Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers to a “student” model the knowledge of an ensemble of “teacher” models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers' answers. However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets. In this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers of output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For this, we introduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that are more selective and add less noise, and prove their tighter differential-privacy guarantees. Our new mechanisms build on two insights: the chance of teacher consensus is increased by using more concentrated noise and, lacking consensus, no answer need be given to a student. The consensus answers used are more likely to be correct, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur lower-differential privacy cost. Our evaluation shows our mechanisms improve on the original PATE on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy ($\epsilon$ {\textless} 1.0).},

This adversarial pattern can be interpreted as a Turing test in GANs. It allows us to use information of real samples during training generator and accelerates the whole training procedure. We even find that just proportionally increasing the size of discriminator and generator, it succeeds on 256x256 resolution without adjusting hyperparameters carefully.},

abstract = {In standard generative adversarial network (SGAN), the discriminator D estimates the probability that the input data is real. The generator G is trained to increase the probability that fake data is real. We argue that it should also simultaneously decrease the probability that real data is real because 1) this would account for a priori knowledge that half of the data in the mini-batch is fake, 2) this would be observed with divergence minimization, and 3) SGAN would be more similar to integral probability metric (IPM) GANs. We show that this property can be induced by using a “relativistic discriminator” which estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function. Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by 400{\%}), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images (256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP and SGAN with spectral normalization.

@article{Bae2020,
abstract = {Typical personal medical data contains sensitive information about individuals. Storing or sharing the personal medical data is thus often risky. For example, a short DNA sequence can provide information that can identify not only an individual, but also his or her relatives. Nonetheless, most countries and researchers agree on the necessity of collecting personal medical data. This stems from the fact that medical data, including genomic data, are an indispensable resource for further research and development regarding disease prevention and treatment. To prevent personal medical data from being misused, techniques to reliably preserve sensitive information should be developed for real world applications. In this paper, we propose a framework called anonymized generative adversarial networks (AnomiGAN), to preserve the privacy of personal medical data, while also maintaining high prediction performance. We compared our method to state-of-The-Art techniques and observed that our method preserves the same level of privacy as differential privacy (DP) and provides better prediction results. We also observed that there is a trade-off between privacy and prediction results that depends on the degree of preservation of the original data. Here, we provide a mathematical overview of our proposed model and demonstrate its validation using UCI machine learning repository datasets in order to highlight its utility in practice. The code is available at https://github.com/hobae/AnomiGAN/.},

abstract = {This work provides the community with a timely comprehensive review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures on deep learning. According to the attacker's capability and affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into six categorizations: code poisoning, outsourcing, pretrained, data collection, collaborative learning and post-deployment. Accordingly, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into four general classes: blind backdoor removal, offline backdoor inspection, online backdoor inspection, and post backdoor removal. Accordingly, we review countermeasures, and compare and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We have also reviewed the flip side of backdoor attacks, which are explored for i) protecting intellectual property of deep learning models, ii) acting as a honeypot to catch adversarial example attacks, and iii) verifying data deletion requested by the data contributor.Overall, the research on defense is far behind the attack, and there is no single defense that can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. In some cases, an attacker can intelligently bypass existing defenses with an adaptive attack. Drawing the insights from the systematic review, we also present key areas for future research on the backdoor, such as empirical security evaluations from physical trigger attacks, and in particular, more efficient and practical countermeasures are solicited.},

abstract = {Limited data access is a substantial barrier to data-driven networking research and development. Although many organizations are motivated to share data, privacy concerns often prevent the sharing of proprietary data, including between teams in the same organization and with outside stakeholders (e.g., researchers, vendors). Many researchers have therefore proposed synthetic data models, most of which have not gained traction because of their narrow scope. In this work, we present DoppelGANger, a synthetic data generation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). DoppelGANger is designed to work on time series datasets with both continuous features (e.g. traffic measurements) and discrete ones (e.g., protocol name). Modeling time series and mixed-type data is known to be difficult; DoppelGANger circumvents these problems through a new conditional architecture that isolates the generation of metadata from time series, but uses metadata to strongly influence time series generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DoppelGANger on three real-world datasets. We show that DoppelGANger achieves up to 43{\%} better fidelity than baseline models, and captures structural properties of data that baseline methods are unable to learn. Additionally, it gives data holders an easy mechanism for protecting attributes of their data without substantial loss of data utility.},

It is known that the success of AI is mostly attributed to the availability of big data with annotations for a single task and the advances in high performance computing. However, medical imaging presents unique challenges that confront deep learning approaches. In this survey paper, we first highlight both clinical needs and technical challenges in medical imaging and describe how emerging trends in deep learning are addressing these issues. We cover the topics of network architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability, uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are commonly found in clinical practice, including digital pathology and chest, brain, cardiovascular, and abdominal imaging. Rather than presenting an exhaustive literature survey, we instead describe some prominent research highlights related to these case study applications. We conclude with a discussion and presentation of promising future directions.},

To achieve this, we present the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV), a system that builds generative models of relational databases. We are able to sample from the model and create synthetic data, hence the name SDV. When implementing the SDV, we also developed an algorithm that computes statistics at the intersection of related database tables. We then used a state-of-The-Art multivariate modeling approach to model this data. The SDV iterates through all possible relations, ultimately creating a model for the entire database. Once this model is computed, the same relational information allows the SDV to synthesize data by sampling from any part of the database. After building the SDV, we used it to generate synthetic data for five different publicly available datasets. We then published these datasets, and asked data scientists to develop predictive models for them as part of a crowdsourced experiment. By analyzing the outcomes, we show that synthetic data can successfully replace original data for data science. Our analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the work produced by data scientists who used synthetic data as opposed to real data. We conclude that the SDV is a viable solution for synthetic data generation.},

A DSP solution is useful for application development (s {\textless} 1), scalability testing (s {\textgreater} 1) and anonymization (s = 1). Current solutions assume all table sizes scale by the same ratio s. However, a real database tends to have tables that grow at different rates. This paper therefore considers non-uniform scaling (nuDSP), a DSP generalization where, instead of a single scale factor s, tables can scale by different factors. DscALER is the first solution for nuDSP. It follows previous work in achieving similarity by reproducing correlation among the primary and foreign keys. However, it introduces the concept of a correlation database that captures fine-grained, per-tuple correlation. Experiments with well-known real and synthetic datasets D show that DsCALER produces D with greater similarity to D than state-of-the-art techniques. Here, similarity is measured by number of tuples, frequency distribution of foreign key references, and multi-join aggregate queries.},

abstract = {The TPC benchmarks have helped users evaluate database system performance at different scales. Although each benchmark is domain-specific, it is not equally relevant to different applications in the same domain. The present proliferation of applications also leaves many of them uncovered by the very limited number of current TPC benchmarks. There is therefore a need to develop tools for application-specific database benchmarking. This paper presents UpSizeR, a software that addresses the Dataset Scaling Problem: Given an empirical set of relational tables D and a scale factor s, generate a database state D{\"{E}}{\oe} that is similar to D but s times its size. Such a tool can be useful for scaling up D for scalability testing (s{\textgreater}1), scaling down for application testing (s{\textless}1), or anonymization (s=1). Experiments with Flickr show that query results and response times on UpSizeR output match those on crawled data. They also accurately predict throughput degradation for a scale out test. The UpSizeR version in this paper focuses on extracting and replicating the correlation induced by the primary and foreign keys. There are many other forms of correlation involving non-key values. It is a large task to develop UpSizeR into a tool that can extract and replicate all important correlation, so community effort is required. The current UpSizeR code has therefore been released for open-source development. The ultimate objective is to replace TPC with UpSizeR, so database owners can generate benchmarks that are relevant to their applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we propose ReX, a novel extrapolation system targeting relational databases that aims to produce a representative extrapolated database given an original one and a natural scaling rate. Furthermore, we evaluate our system in comparison with an existing realistic scaling method, UpSizeR, by measuring the representativeness of the extrapolated database to the original one, the accuracy for approximate query answering, the database size, and their performance.

@article{Harada2019,
abstract = {The effectiveness of biosignal generation and data augmentation with biosignal generative models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are a type of deep learning technique, was demonstrated in our previous paper. GAN-based generative models only learn the projection between a random distribution as input data and the distribution of training data. Therefore, the relationship between input and generated data is unclear, and the characteristics of the data generated from this model cannot be controlled. This study proposes a method for generating time-series data based on GANs and explores their ability to generate biosignals with certain classes and characteristics. Moreover, in the proposed method, latent variables are analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to represent the relationship between input and generated data as canonical loadings. Using these loadings, we can control the characteristics of the data generated by the proposed method. The influence of class labels on generated data is analyzed by feeding the data interpolated between two class labels into the generator of the proposed GANs. The CCA of the latent variables is shown to be an effective method of controlling the generated data characteristics. We are able to model the distribution of the time-series data without requiring domain-dependent knowledge using the proposed method. Furthermore, it is possible to control the characteristics of these data by analyzing the model trained using the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate biosignals using GANs while controlling the characteristics of the generated data.},

abstract = {Intake of drugs may influence the interpretation of laboratory test results. Knowledge and correct interpretation of possible drug-laboratory test interactions (DLTIs) is important for physicians, pharmacists and laboratory specialists. Laboratory results may be affected by analytical or physiological effects of medication. Failure to take into account the possible unintended influence of drug use on a laboratory test result may lead to incorrect diagnosis, incorrect treatment and unnecessary follow-up. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the literature investigating the clinical impact and use of DLTI decision support systems on laboratory test interpretation. Particular interactions were reported in a large number of articles, but they were fragmentarily described and some papers even reported contradictory findings. To provide an overview of information that clinicians and laboratory staff need to interpret test results, DLTI databases have been made by several groups. In a literature search, only four relevant studies have been found on DLTI decision support applications for laboratory test interpretation in clinical practice. These studies show a potential benefit of automated DLTI messages to physicians for the correct interpretation of laboratory test results. Physicians reported 30-100{\%} usefulness of DLTI messages. In one study 74{\%} of physicians sometimes even refrained from further additional examination. The benefit of decision support increases when a refined set of clinical rules is determined in cooperation with health care professionals. The prevalence of DLTIs is high in a broad range of combinations of laboratory tests and drugs and these frequently remain unrecognized.},

abstract = {Differential privacy is a strong notion for privacy that can be used to prove formal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, $\epsilon$, about how much information is leaked by a mechanism. When used in privacy-preserving machine learning, the goal is typically to limit what can be inferred from the model about individual training records. However, the calibration of the privacy budget is not well understood. Implementations of privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of $\epsilon$ in order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where iterative learning procedures are used, relaxed definitions of differential privacy are often used which appear to reduce the needed privacy budget but present poorly understood trade-offs between privacy and utility. In this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main finding is that there is no way to obtain privacy for free-relaxed definitions of differential privacy that reduce the amount of noise needed to improve utility also increase the measured privacy leakage. Current mechanisms for differentially private machine learning rarely offer acceptable utility-privacy trade-offs for complex learning tasks: settings that provide limited accuracy loss provide little effective privacy, and settings that provide strong privacy result in useless models.},

In particular, the R{\'{e}}nyi divergence of order 1 equals the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review and extend the most important properties of R{\'{e}}nyi divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence, including convexity, continuity, limits of $\backslash$($\backslash$sigma $\backslash$) -algebras, and the relation of the special order 0 to the Gaussian dichotomy and contiguity. We also show how to generalize the Pythagorean inequality to orders different from 1, and we extend the known equivalence between channel capacity and minimax redundancy to continuous channel inputs (for all orders) and present several other minimax results. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Interpretation of latent spaces is challenging because prior knowledge, sometimes subtle and implicit, is essential to the process. We contribute methods for “latent space cartography”, the process of mapping and comparing meaningful semantic dimensions within latent spaces. We first perform a literature survey of relevant machine learning, natural language processing, and scientific research to distill common tasks and propose a workflow process. Next, we present an integrated visual analysis system for supporting this workflow, enabling users to discover, define, and verify meaningful relationships among data points, encoded within latent space dimensions. Three case studies demonstrate how users of our system can compare latent space variants in image generation, challenge existing findings on cancer transcriptomes, and assess a word embedding benchmark.},

abstract = {Background: A living cell has a complex, hierarchically organized signaling system that encodes and assimilates diverse environmental and intracellular signals, and it further transmits signals that control cellular responses, including a tightly controlled transcriptional program. An important and yet challenging task in systems biology is to reconstruct cellular signaling system in a data-driven manner. In this study, we investigate the utility of deep hierarchical neural networks in learning and representing the hierarchical organization of yeast transcriptomic machinery. Results: We have designed a sparse autoencoder model consisting of a layer of observed variables and four layers of hidden variables. We applied the model to over a thousand of yeast microarrays to learn the encoding system of yeast transcriptomic machinery. After model selection, we evaluated whether the trained models captured biologically sensible information. We show that the latent variables in the first hidden layer correctly captured the signals of yeast transcription factors (TFs), obtaining a close to one-to-one mapping between latent variables and TFs. We further show that genes regulated by latent variables at higher hidden layers are often involved in a common biological process, and the hierarchical relationships between latent variables conform to existing knowledge. Finally, we show that information captured by the latent variables provide more abstract and concise representations of each microarray, enabling the identification of better separated clusters in comparison to gene-based representation. Conclusions: Contemporary deep hierarchical latent variable models, such as the autoencoder, can be used to partially recover the organization of transcriptomic machinery.},

abstract = {Background: Unsupervised compression algorithms applied to gene expression data extract latent or hidden signals representing technical and biological sources of variation. However, these algorithms require a user to select a biologically appropriate latent space dimensionality. In practice, most researchers fit a single algorithm and latent dimensionality. We sought to determine the extent by which selecting only one fit limits the biological features captured in the latent representations and, consequently, limits what can be discovered with subsequent analyses. Results: We compress gene expression data from three large datasets consisting of adult normal tissue, adult cancer tissue, and pediatric cancer tissue. We train many different models across a large range of latent space dimensionalities and observe various performance differences. We identify more curated pathway gene sets significantly associated with individual dimensions in denoising autoencoder and variational autoencoder models trained using an intermediate number of latent dimensionalities. Combining compressed features across algorithms and dimensionalities captures the most pathway-associated representations. When trained with different latent dimensionalities, models learn strongly associated and generalizable biological representations including sex, neuroblastoma MYCN amplification, and cell types. Stronger signals, such as tumor type, are best captured in models trained at lower dimensionalities, while more subtle signals such as pathway activity are best identified in models trained with more latent dimensionalities. Conclusions: There is no single best latent dimensionality or compression algorithm for analyzing gene expression data. Instead, using features derived from different compression models across multiple latent space dimensionalities enhances biological representations.},

However, most of the data is collected in safe scenarios leading to the duplication of trajectories which are easy to be handled by currently developed algorithms. When considering safety, testing algorithms in near-miss scenarios that rarely show up in off-the-shelf datasets is a vital part of the evaluation. As a remedy, we propose a near-miss data synthesizing framework based on Variational Bayesian methods and term it as Conditional Multiple Trajectory Synthesizer (CMTS). We leverage a generative model conditioned on road maps to bridge safe and collision driving data by representing their distribution in the latent space. By sampling from the near-miss distribution, we can synthesize safety-critical data crucial for understanding traffic scenarios but not shown in neither the original dataset nor the collision dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that the augmented dataset covers more kinds of driving scenarios, especially the near-miss ones, which help improve the trajectory prediction accuracy and the capability of dealing with risky driving scenarios.},

@article{Wang2020latent,
abstract = {The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial attacks has been widely demonstrated (e.g., adversarial example attacks). Traditional attacks perform unstructured pixel-wise perturbation to fool the classifier. An alternative approach is to have perturbations in the latent space. However, such perturbations are hard to control due to the lack of interpretability and disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a more practical adversarial attack by designing structured perturbation with semantic meanings. Our proposed technique manipulates the semantic attributes of images via the disentangled latent codes. The intuition behind our technique is that images in similar domains have some commonly shared but theme-independent semantic attributes, e.g. thickness of lines in handwritten digits, that can be bidirectionally mapped to disentangled latent codes. We generate adversarial perturbation by manipulating a single or a combination of these latent codes and propose two unsupervised semantic manipulation approaches: vector-based disentangled representation and feature map-based disentangled representation, in terms of the complexity of the latent codes and smoothness of the reconstructed images. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on real-world image data to demonstrate the power of our attacks for black-box classifiers. We further demonstrate the existence of a universal, image-agnostic semantic adversarial example.},

Unlike previous methods that focus on dissecting models via feature visualization, the emphasis of this work is put on the variables in latent space, i.e. how the latent variables affect the quantitative analysis of generated results. Given a pretrained GAN model with weights fixed, the latent variables are intervened to analyze their effect on the semantic content in generated images. A set of controlling latent variables can be derived for specific content generation, and the controllable semantic content manipulation be achieved.

However, disentangling the different factors that give rise to individual variability is still an outstanding challenge. In this paper, we introduce a deep generative modeling approach to find different modes of variation across many individuals. To do this, we start by training a variational autoencoder on a collection of auto-fluorescence images from a little over 1,700 mouse brains at 25 micron resolution. To then tap into the learned factors and validate the model's expressiveness, we developed a novel bi-directional technique to interpret the latent space-by making structured perturbations to both, the high-dimensional inputs of the network, as well as the low-dimensional latent variables in its bottleneck. Our results demonstrate that through coupling generative modeling frameworks with structured perturbations, it is possible to probe the latent space to provide insights into the representations of brain structure formed in deep neural networks.

These tasks cover a range of clinical problems including modeling risk of mortality, forecasting length of stay, detecting physiologic decline, and phenotype classification. We propose strong linear and neural baselines for all four tasks and evaluate the effect of deep supervision, multitask training and data-specific architectural modifications on the performance of neural models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02663},
	abstract = {Forecasting models that are trained across sets of many time series, known as Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising results in forecasting competitions and real-world applications, outperforming many state-of-the-art univariate forecasting techniques. In most cases, GFMs are implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which require a sufficient amount of time series to estimate their numerous model parameters. However, many time series databases have only a limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data augmentation based forecasting framework that is capable of improving the baseline accuracy of the GFM models in less data-abundant settings. We use three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS, moving block bootstrap (MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA) to synthetically generate a collection of time series. The knowledge acquired from these augmented time series is then transferred to the original dataset using two different approaches: the pooled approach and the transfer learning approach. When building GFMs, in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented time series alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer learning approach, we adapt a pre-trained model to the new dataset. In our evaluation on competition and real-world time series datasets, our proposed variants can significantly improve the baseline accuracy of GFM models and outperform state-of-the-art univariate forecasting methods.},

Many of the existing approaches for generating synthetic data are often limited in terms of complexity and realism. We introduce SynSys, a machine learning-based synthetic data generation method, to improve upon these limitations. We use this method to generate synthetic time series data that is composed of nested sequences using hidden Markov models and regression models which are initially trained on real datasets. We test our synthetic data generation technique on a real annotated smart home dataset. We use time series distance measures as a baseline to determine how realistic the generated data is compared to real data and demonstrate that SynSys produces more realistic data in terms of distance compared to random data generation, data from another home, and data from another time period. Finally, we apply our synthetic data generation technique to the problem of generating data when only a small amount of ground truth data is available. Using semi-supervised learning we demonstrate that SynSys is able to improve activity recognition accuracy compared to using the small amount of real data alone.},

A valuable source of information for researchers is the large amount of digital health data that are continuously collected by electronic health record systems at health care organizations. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be the key legal framework with regard to using and sharing European digital health data for research purposes. However, concerns persist that the GDPR has made many organizations very risk-averse in terms of data sharing, even if the regulation permits such sharing. Health care organizations focusing on individual risk minimization threaten to undermine COVID-19 research efforts. In our opinion, there is an ethical obligation to use the research exemption clause of the GDPR during the COVID-19 pandemic to support global collaborative health research efforts. Solidarity is a European value, and here is a chance to exemplify it by using the GDPR regulatory framework in a way that does not hinder but actually fosters solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The goal of this work is twofold: we present a comparison between missing data imputation solutions based on deep generative models, and we propose improvements over those methodologies. We run our experiments using known real life datasets with different characteristics, removing values at random and reconstructing them with several imputation techniques. Our results show that the presence or absence of categorical variables can alter the selection of the best model, and that some models are more stable than others after similar runs with different random number generator seeds.},

With the rise of generative models in deep learning, recent studies proposed solutions to the problem of imputing missing values based various deep generative models.

For these data, the case for deep generative models seems to be less clear. In the process of providing a fair comparison of proposed methods, we uncover several issues when assessing the status quo: the use of under-speciﬁed and ambiguous dataset names, the large range of parameters and hyper-parameters to tune for each method, and the use of different metrics and evaluation methods.},

InfoGAN is a generative adversarial network that also maximizes the mutual information between a small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We derive a lower bound of the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images, and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with representations learned by existing supervised methods.

Requirements for batch processing and accurate recognition of clinical data have led to the applications of deep-learning methods for feature extraction, classification, and denoising of ECGs; however, deep learning requires large amounts of data and multi-feature integration of datasets, with most available methods used for ECGs incapable of extracting global features or resulting in unstable, low quality training. To address these deficiencies, we proposed a novel generative adversarial architecture called RPSeqGAN using a training process reliant upon a sequence generative adversarial network (SeqGAN) algorithm that adopts the policy gradient (PG) in reinforcement learning. Based on clinical records collected from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, we compared our proposed model with three deep generative models to evaluate its stability by observing the variance of their loss curves. Additionally, we generated ECGs with five periods and evaluated them according to six metrics suitable for time series. The results indicate that the proposed model showed the highest stability and data quality.},

                 Disease (AD) modeling, however, there remains a need for a
                 simulator that represents the full scope of disease
                 progression and can be used to study new disease-modifying
                 treatments for early-stage and even prodromal AD. Methods: We
                 developed AD Archimedes condition-event simulator, a
                 patient-level simulator with a focus on simulating the effects
                 of early interventions through changes in biomarkers of AD.
                 The simulator incorporates interconnected predictive equations
                 derived from longitudinal data sets. Results: The results of
                 external validations on AD Archimedes condition-event
                 simulator showed that it provides reasonable estimates once
                 compared to literature results on transition to dementia AD,

                 modeling and cellular automata (CA) techniques to simulate the
                 behavior of patients in an ED. After verifying and validating
                 the model by comparing it with data from a real case study,
                 the significance of four preventive policies including
                 increasing number of triage nurses, fast-track treatment,
                 increasing the waiting room capacity and reducing treatment
                 time were investigated by utilizing ordinary least squares
                 regression. After applying the preventing policies in ED, an
                 average of 42.14\% reduction in the number of patients who
                 leave without being seen and 6.05\% reduction in the average
                 length of stay (LOS) of patients was reported. This study is
                 the first to apply CA in an ED simulation. Comparing the
                 average LOS before and after applying CA with actual times
                 from emergency department information system showed an 11\%
                 improvement. The simulation results indicated that the most
                 effective approach to reduce the rate of LWBS is applying
                 fast-track treatment. The ABM approach represents a flexible

Noise is often associated with the ECG signal recording process. Denoising is central to most of the ECG signal processing tasks. The current ECG denoising techniques are based on the time domain signal decomposition methods. These methods use some kind of thresholding and filtering approaches. In our proposed technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) based GAN model is effectively trained for ECG noise filtering. In contrast to existing techniques, we performed end-to-end GAN model training using the clean and noisy ECG signals. MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database is used for all the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The improved ECG denoising performance open the door for further exploration of GAN based ECG denoising approach.},

Common methods of de-identification implemented to enable the sharing of data are sometimes inadequate to protect the individuals contained in the data. For our research, we investigate the ability of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic medical time series data which can be used without concerns over privacy. The aim is to generate synthetic ECG signals representative of normal ECG waveforms. GANs have been used successfully to generate good quality synthetic time series and have been shown to prevent re-identification of individual records. In this work, a range of GAN architectures are developed to generate synthetic sine waves and synthetic ECG. Two evaluation metrics are then used to quantitatively assess how suitable the synthetic data is for real world applications such as clinical training and data analysis. Finally, we discuss the privacy concerns associated with sharing synthetic data produced by GANs and test their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack. For the first time we both quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that GAN architecture can successfully generate time series signals that are not only structurally similar to the training sets but also diverse in nature across generated samples. We also report on their ability to withstand a simple membership inference attack, protecting the privacy of the training set.},

Here we describe EEG-GAN as a framework to generate electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. We introduce a modification to the improved training of Wasserstein GANs to stabilize training and investigate a range of architectural choices critical for time series generation (most notably up- and down-sampling). For evaluation we consider and compare different metrics such as Inception score, Frechet inception distance and sliced Wasserstein distance, together showing that our EEG-GAN framework generated naturalistic EEG examples. It thus opens up a range of new generative application scenarios in the neuroscientific and neurological context, such as data augmentation in brain-computer interfacing tasks, EEG super-sampling, or restoration of corrupted data segments. The possibility to generate signals of a certain class and/or with specific properties may also open a new avenue for research into the underlying structure of brain signals.},

  abstract      = "The way we look at data has a great impact on how we can
                   understand it, particularly when the data is related to
                   health and wellness. Due to the increased use of
                   self-tracking devices and the ongoing shift towards
                   preventive medicine, better understanding of our health data
                   is an important part of improving the general welfare of the
                   citizens. Electronic Health Records, self-tracking devices
                   and mobile applications provide a rich variety of data but
                   it often becomes difficult to understand. We implemented the
                   hFigures library inspired on the hGraph visualization with
                   additional improvements. The purpose of the library is to
                   provide a visual representation of the evolution of health
                   measurements in a complete and useful manner. We researched
                   the usefulness and usability of the library by building an
                   application for health data visualization in a health
                   coaching program. We performed a user evaluation with
                   Heuristic Evaluation, Controlled User Testing and Usability
                   Questionnaires. In the Heuristics Evaluation the average
                   response was 6.3 out of 7 points and the Cognitive
                   Walkthrough done by usability experts indicated no design or
                   mismatch errors. In the CSUQ usability test the system
                   obtained an average score of 6.13 out of 7, and in the ASQ
                   usability test the overall satisfaction score was 6.64 out
                   of 7. We developed hFigures, an open source library for
                   visualizing a complete, accurate and normalized graphical
                   representation of health data. The idea is based on the
                   concept of the hGraph but it provides additional key
                   features, including a comparison of multiple health
                   measurements over time. We conducted a usability evaluation
                   of the library as a key component of an application for
                   health and wellness monitoring. The results indicate that
                   the data visualization library was helpful in assisting

  abstract    = "This generation faces existential threats because of the
                 global assault of the novel Corona virus 2019 (i.e.,
                 COVID-19). With more than thirteen million infected and nearly
                 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the
                 worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are
                 traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent
                 or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation
                 of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and
                 mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via
                 quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social
                 distancing that are focused on ``flattening the curve''. While
                 medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the
                 battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity.
                 Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been
                 revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose
                 potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art
                 technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and
                 treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and,
                 particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because
                 their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of
                 data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of
                 engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the
                 ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one
                 side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study
                 presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability
                 of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the
                 Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep
                 learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy
                 of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement
                 in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and
                 testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data
                 augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4\% to 11\% in
                 COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the
                 proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the
                 machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm
                 is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus
                 diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in
                 making accurate identification of the virus.",

                 patient-derived health information for research purposes.
                 Consequently, data anonymization is required to allow
                 researchers data access for initial analysis before granting
                 institutional review board approval. A system installed and
                 activated at our institution enables synthetic data generation
                 that mimics data from real electronic medical records, wherein
                 only fictitious patients are listed. OBJECTIVE: This paper
                 aimed to validate the results obtained when analyzing
                 synthetic structured data for medical research. A
                 comprehensive validation process concerning meaningful
                 clinical questions and various types of data was conducted to
                 assess the accuracy and precision of statistical estimates
                 derived from synthetic patient data. METHODS: A cross-hospital
                 project was conducted to validate results obtained from
                 synthetic data produced for five contemporary studies on
                 various topics. For each study, results derived from synthetic
                 data were compared with those based on real data. In addition,
                 repeatedly generated synthetic datasets were used to estimate
                 the bias and stability of results obtained from synthetic
                 data. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that results derived
                 from synthetic data were predictive of results from real data.
                 When the number of patients was large relative to the number
                 of variables used, highly accurate and strongly consistent
                 results were observed between synthetic and real data. For
                 studies based on smaller populations that accounted for
                 confounders and modifiers by multivariate models, predictions
                 were of moderate accuracy, yet clear trends were correctly
                 observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of synthetic structured data
                 provides a close estimate to real data results and is thus a
                 powerful tool in shaping research hypotheses and accessing
                 estimated analyses, without risking patient privacy. Synthetic
                 data enable broad access to data (eg, for out-of-organization
                 researchers), and rapid, safe, and repeatable analysis of data
                 in hospitals or other health organizations where patient
                 privacy is a primary value.",

               We present a case study in the development of a synthetic data
               system and highlight potential applications of synthetic data.
               We begin with an overview of synthetic data, what it is, how it
               has been utilized thus far, and the potential benefits and
               concerns in its application to education data systems. We then

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Objective Our goal was to create a synthetic dataset and
              curricular materials to assist in teaching fundamentals of
              translational data science.Materials and Methods A literature
              review was conducted to extract current cardiovascular risk score
              logic, data elements, and population characteristics. Then,
              clinical data elements in the models were pulled from clinical
              data and transformed to the Observational Medical Outcomes
              Partnership (OMOP) common data model; genetic data elements were
              added based on population rates. A hybrid Bayesian network was
              used to create synthetic data from the logical elements of the
              risk scores and the underlying population frequencies of the
              clinical data.Results A synthetic dataset of 446,000 patients was
              created. A two-day curriculum was created based on this synthetic
              data with exploratory data analysis and machine learning
              components. The curriculum was offered on two separate occasions;
              the two groups of learners were given the curriculum and data,
              and results were tallied, summarized, and compared. Students'
              ability to complete the challenge was mixed; more experienced
              students achieved a range of 70\%-85\% in balanced accuracy, but
              many others did not perform better than the baseline
              model.Discussion Overall, students enjoyed the course and
              dataset, but some struggled to consistently apply machine
              learning techniques. The curriculum, data set, techniques for
              generation, and results are available for others to use for their
              own training.Conclusion A realistic synthetic data with clinical
              and genetic components helps students learn issues in
              cardiovascular risk scoring, practice data science skills, and
              compete in a challenge to improve identification of risk.",
