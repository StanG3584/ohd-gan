 \subsection{Data Types and Feature Engineering}
    No publications made use of \gls{ohd} in its initial form, patient records in \glspl{gan} composed of many related tables (Normal form). The complexiety of a model wouuld grow rapibldy when maintaining referential inegrty and statistics between multiple tables. The hierarchy by witch these would interact with each other conditionally is no less complicated (see discussion Section \todo{section reference with a mention of a few statistical solutions that faced a number of problems}. There are however published \gls{gan} algorithms made to consume normalized database in their original form. \todo In regards to \gls{ohd}, feature engineering was used to adapt the data to task requirements, or to a promising algorithms that fit the date characteristics. The data is transformed into one of four modalities: time series, point-processes, ordered sequences or aggregates described in Fig. \ref{tab:features}
