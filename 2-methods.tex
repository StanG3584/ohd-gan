\section{Methods}

    \input{tables/search}
    
    Publications concerning \gls{ohd-gan} were identified through with Google Scholar \cite{scholar}, Web of Science \cite{Clarivate} and Prophy \cite{Prophy}. The terms and operators found in Table \ref{tab:themes} form the search query. We included studies reporting the development, application, performance evaluation and privacy evaluation of \gls{gan} algorithms to produce \gls{ohd}. We define \gls{ohd} as categorical, real-valued, ordinal or binary event data recorded for patient care. We list a more detailed summary of the included and excluded data types in Table \ref{tab:datatypes}. The excluded data types are already the subject of one or more review, or would merit a review of their own \cite{Yi_2019, Nakata2019, Anwar_2018, Wang2020, Zhou2020}. In each of the included publications, we considered the aspects listed in Table \ref{tab:search}.\par
