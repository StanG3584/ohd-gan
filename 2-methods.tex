    Publications concerning \gls{ohd-gan} were identified through with Google Scholar and Web of Science. The search input was formed from the terms and operators found in Table \ref{tab:themes}. We included studies reporting the development, application, performance evaluation and privacy evaluation of \gls{gan} algorithms to produce \gls{ohd}. Broadly, we define the scope of \gls{ohd} as low-dimensional data recorded for patient care. A more detailed summary of the included and excluded data types can be found in Table \ref{tab:datatypes}. The data types are already the subject of one or more review, or would merit a review of their own \cite{Yi_2019, Nakata2019, Anwar_2018}. In each of the included publications, we analyzed the aspects listed in Table \ref{tab:search}.\par
