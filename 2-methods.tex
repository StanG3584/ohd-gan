Publications concerning OHD-GAN were identified through searches by Google Scholar and Web of Science, with the the query formed from the terms and operators found in Table ???. We included studies reporting the development, application, performance evaluation and privacy evaluation of GAN algorithms to produce OHD. Broadly, we define the scope of OHD to be considered as low-dimensional data recorded for patient care. A more detailed summary of the included and excluded data types can be found in Figure 2. Excluded data types are already the subject of a review or would merit a review of their own \cite{Yi_2019}\cite{Nakata2019}\cite{Anwar_2018}. In each of the publications, we analyzed the aspects listed in Table \ref{tab:search}.\par
