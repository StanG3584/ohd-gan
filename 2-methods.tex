Publications concerning \gls{ohd-gan} were identified through searches by Google Scholar and Web of Science, with the the query formed from the terms and operators found in Table \ref{tab:themes}. We included studies reporting the development, application, performance evaluation and privacy evaluation of gls{gan} algorithms to produce gls{ohd}. Broadly, we define the scope of gls{ohd} to be considered as low-dimensional data recorded for patient care. A more detailed summary of the included and excluded data types can be found in Table \ref{tab:datatypes}. Excluded data types are already the subject of a review or would merit a review of their own \cite{Yi_2019}\cite{Nakata2019}\cite{Anwar_2018}. In each of the publications, we analyzed the aspects listed in Table \ref{tab:search}.\par
