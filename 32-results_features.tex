 \subsection{Data Types and Feature Engineering}
    No publications made use of OHD in its initial form, patient records in EHR composed of many related tables. There are however published algorithms treating this form of data in other domains. \todo In the case of OHD, feature engineering was used to adapt the data to task requirements, or to make it intelligible for particular algorithms. The data is transformed into one of four modalities: time series, point-processes, ordered sequences or aggregates described in Fig. \ref{tab:features}.
