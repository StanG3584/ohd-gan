\section{Conclusion}
\normalsize
\Gls{sd} has been a subject of interest for quite some time, with officials seeing enough value to launch longitudinal state-wide endeavours such as the Synthetic Data Project (SDP), funded by the United States Department of Education(USDOE) \cite{Bonnery2019-ug}. They dismiss a series of anonymization techniques, stating the burden on worker and financial resources, and the privacy guarantees that would not sufficient for governmental agencies. Issues that have only gained weight with the accumulation of big data, and the number of new sources growing consistently. The questions they hoped to answer at the start of the project in 2016 are still not fully answered (evaluation, scientific validity, legal implications). Their 2019 report on the experience is packed with interesting insights. Noting the distrust people tend to have of synthetic data, they were the ones who first proposed the idea conducting experiments on synthetic data, that could then be confirmed on real data by simply sending the analysis to the data holder (with the logistics described extensively and augmented by a flowchart).\par

The publication ends with a series case reports. The instances where the data could not satisfy requirements are analyzed with the aim of informing similar projects in the future. However the bulk of reports describe cases where was highly applicable. They concluded by predicting that the cost of generating \gls{sd} will diminish and that the methods to do so will improve. Their hopes for \gls{sd} include: easier access for researcher to the wealth of data, increased access providing downstream benefits at the state level, the these benefits encourage others to undertake similar projects that would increase generalizability of findings across states, and a preference for open data.

    "[although some argue for] having secured data centers for administrative data utilization [...], our experience suggests that such centers may not solve the desire for fast turn-around research or broaden access to those with unique perspectives. Synthetic data represent a promising approach for increasing easy access to secure data while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of individuals."}{\textit{Daniel Bonnéry, Yi Feng, Angela K.

The \gls{gan} was devised in 2014 in Montreal, Canada by \citeauthor{goodgan} at Université de Montreal. Two years before the start of the SDP, which must of been planned over a few years. It was too early for them to know about this obscure technique based on two neural networks competing against each other. Since then, \href{http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets}{Generative Adversarial Networks} \cite{goodgan} has inspired \textbf{23805} citations and algorithms capable of synthesizing data of impeccable similitude. We have surveyed a multitude of \gls{gan} algo
