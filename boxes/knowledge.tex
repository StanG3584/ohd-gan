The prospect of GANs being able go incorporate auxiliary information or constraints they  can automatically learn to optimize is  a golden research opportunity. This would empower them with the prior knowledge until now reserved to model in the category of the same name, while keeping their  ability to learn in an unsupervised adversarial framework.
