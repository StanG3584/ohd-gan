  \begin{tabular}{llll} \toprule
  
  Type & Source and format & Challenges & Features engineering\\ \midrule
  
  Time-series & Automatic measurements at fixed time intervals by medical equipment or medical professionals. & Often sporadic, with many missing observations across time end dimensions. & Data imputation, imputation coupled with training, binning in into fixed-size intervals or combination of binning and imputation\\
  Point-processes & Time intervals between medical events, such as hospital visits. & & Timestamped events transformed into the time delta between each consecutive occurrences.\\
  Ordered sequences & Variable-length, ordered vectors of medical codes & Large number of codes and variable length. & Sequences are projected into a trained embedding that preserves semantic meaning
  according to methods borrowed from NLP.\\
  Tabular & Continuous, ordinal and categorical features in tabular form. & Mixture of discrete features with high class imbalance and multi-modal continuous features. & Medical history is aggregated into a fixed-size vector of binary or aggregated counts of occurrences and combined with demographic features.\\
